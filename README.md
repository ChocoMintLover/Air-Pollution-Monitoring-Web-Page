# AI, Please let me know the air condition!

This project is a system for monitoring and predicting air pollution levels, utilizing two main AI technologies to provide information about air quality.

## Key Features

1. **Hugging Face Chatbot (Air Pollution Advice for Today)**  
   - A chatbot powered by the Hugging Face API that provides advice about today's air pollution levels based on user queries.

2. **GRU-based Air Pollution Prediction Model**  
   - A GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) model trained on 3 years of air pollution data from one city and 1 year of data from 8 other cities.
   - This model predicts future air pollution levels and visualizes them.

3. **Today's Weather and Air Pollution Information**  
   - Provides today's weather information (temperature, humidity, weather condition) for a given city, along with the air quality index (AQI).
   - Also visualizes the air pollution levels of the selected city for the past 30 days in a graph.
